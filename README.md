# playwright-tutorial
I am an experienced software tester and have worked with several test automation systems at Adobe. I want to make the transisiton from a test automation user to a test automation creater.

Playwright is an indemand skill and I already have experience with JavaScript and TypeScript. I figure the best way to understand a technology well is to document what you learn and explain it to others.

I hope this content will help other explor and learn Playwright.
