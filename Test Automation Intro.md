# What is test automation?
All software wether it runs on a computer, mobile device or within a web page has to be tested. If you have ever used a program that did not work well (or at all) you will understand the need for well tested software.

# Manual Testing
Manual testing, sometimes called Black Box testing or hands-on testing, is way to test software as if you were the user. Click buttons, enter text into fields... While manual testing does not typically require development skills, domain expertise with the software is critical. If you understand how the user will interact with the software, you can duplicate those steps when testing. The term Black Box is used because the tester does not have access to the source code. The mechanics of how the software works can't be seen: hence a Black Box.

## Manual Testing Strengths and Weaknesses
The advantage of manual testing is that you are using the software exactly as a user would. Often the very best bugs are found during manual testing. During manual testing you might intentionally enter invalid information such as a password and verify that the software handles that mistake correctly. If you enter the wrong password and you can still continue, that is an important security flaw. Creativity is critical for manual testing. For example, you are testing a UI element that has several tabs. Click rapidly through the tabs using a mouse and tab key. Did the software freeze and any point? Did it crash? Manual testing is the last line of defense for software releases.

While manual testing is great for finding real-world bugs it my its nature time consuming (if done well!). Software creation is a complex and includes many pieces of technology coming together. The software can dramatically during the development process either due to major architectural changes or new requirements from marketing or sales. To efficiently evaluate the state of the code (e.g. is good enough for manual testing) test automation is necessary. 

## Automated Testing Strengths and Weaknesses
While efficient, automated testing can't exactly replicate the experience of a real life user. It can come close but is not a substitute for manual testing. Automated testing takes a big investment in test development, test maintenance, test expansion and hardware support. The big advantage of test automation over manual testing is that it is highly scalable. Once you have your test automated, you can run it on more hardware and get results faster. If your test automation can't be scaled, then it may not be worth the investment.

The term Continual Integration/Continual Delivery (CI/CD) means that you software is always ready to be shipped to the customer. While manual testing certainly plays a role in CI/CD it can not respond quickly enough to changing software. This is where test automation comes in. Every single time a developer submits new code, test automation is triggered.
* Does the software build? You would be surprised how often the software won't even build after code changes.
* Does the software pass basic automated tests? Often referred to as a smoke or acceptance test, does the software work on the most basic level?
* Does the software crash or stall? Automated tests can run on many different hardware platforms. Crashes often are platform (Windows vs Mac) specific.
* Does the software run slower? The software may work but many be slower than it used to be. Performance problems are a top priority for developers and users.
* Doe the software have any security issues? Security is probably the number one priority for developers and software companies.

# Where does Playwright fit?
Playwright is a system for automating browser-bases software testing. In a sense, it tries to duplicate the actions a user would use on that web page. There are several popular browsers and your software typically has to be tested on all of them. Playwright allows you to verify your software on multiple browsers automatically. I.e. Playwright allows you to scale your browser testing.
